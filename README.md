## Description

This is a full stack MERN application using the Google Books API search engine that was refactored from functional RESTful API's to utilize GraphQL and the Apollo server. Users are able to sign up or login (utilizing JSON Web Token to store user login information), search for books and save them to their user profiles. Books are displayed with images as well as author name(s) and a description about them. Users are also able to remove books from their profiles. GraphQL is beneficial in that it limits the number of calls to server and allows applications to run more efficiently.
